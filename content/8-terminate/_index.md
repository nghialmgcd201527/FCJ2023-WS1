#### SAM-created Resources

The simplest way to delete resources created by SAM is to use the `sam delete` command. However, before running that command, you need to make sure that the S3 bucket containing the uploaded images has been cleaned up.

Use the command `aws s3 ls` to see the list of files in the bucket. Please do as shown.

You should see a bucket named **uploads-tasks-app-ap-southeast-1-127779471063** where **ap-southeast-1** is your region and **127779471063** is the ID of your AWS account.

Go to the **/sam** directory with the command `cd ~/environment/serverless-tasks-webapp/sam`. The bucket for this workshop is versioning enabled so you have to clean it up using the AWS SDK. Find the **emtpy_versioned_bucket.py** file in the **/sam** directory and modify it by editing the bucket name above after running the command `aws s3 ls`. Save the file and run the following command to clean up the bucket:

```
python empty_versioned_bucket.py

```

We will have a result like this:

Now we can run the command:

```
sam delete
```

So we have successfully deleted the resources generated by SAM.

Di chuyển vào thư mục **/webapp,** chúng ta có thể xóa Amplify project bằng câu lệnh:

```
cd ~/environment/serverless-tasks-webapp/webapp

```

After successful deletion, we will see as shown:

Remember to go to the IAM console, select the user **amplify-user** created in [step 2.4 - Installing Amplify CLI](/en/2-prerequiste/2.4-installamplifycli) and delete it with the generated Access Key output because it is not automatically deleted when `amplify delete` is run.

#### CloudWatch Logs

You must delete the log groups in CloudWatch Logs and streams generated while using the application. Go to **CloudWatch Logs** console, then go to **Log groups** in the left navigation bar, select this workshop's Log groups and delete them.

So we've cleaned up all the resources in this workshop.
